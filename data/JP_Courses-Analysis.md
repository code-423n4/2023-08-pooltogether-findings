Today was one of the worst days in my life. I'm hurting badly.

I came back to my place in the afternoon, and I started this audit contest as a speedrun. It was really difficult to focus, but I managed to submit 3 or so findings.

I didnt have much time to read the docs. I still need to wrap my head around Prize pools and auctions.

Let this be a reminder, when something is important enough to fight for, like my web3 security journey and eventual great success, not even one of the worst days in my life should keep me away from pushing forward with my participation in audit contests.

Thanks for understanding. Hopefully my findings not rubbish.
