1 . Target : https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-cgda-liquidator/blob/7f95bcacd4a566c2becb98d55c1886cadbaa8897/src/LiquidationPair.sol

- Use the uint96 type instead of the uint112 type for the _amountInForPeriod and _amountOutForPeriod variables. This will save 2 bytes per variable, which can add up over time.
- Use the uint48 type instead of the uint256 type for the _lastAuctionTime variable. This will save 8 bytes, which can also add up over time.
- Use the convert() function to convert between the SD59x18 type and the uint256 type. This will avoid having to pack and unpack the values, which can save gas.
- Use the _getElapsedTime() function to compute the elapsed time within the auction instead of computing it manually. This will save gas by avoiding the need to perform multiple multiplications.
- Use the _computePeriod() function to compute the current auction period instead of storing the period as a separate variable. This will save gas by avoiding the need to read and write the period variable.

- Use mappings instead of arrays. Mappings are more gas-efficient than arrays, especially for large datasets. In this contract, the allPairs array is used to track all of the LiquidationPair contracts that have been created by the factory. This array could be replaced with a mapping, which would save gas.
- Minimize on-chain data. The less data that is stored on-chain, the less gas will be required to access it. In this contract, the PairCreated event emits a lot of data, including the addresses of the LiquidationPair contract, the liquidation source, the input and output tokens, and the auction parameters. Some of this data could be omitted from the event, which would save gas.

3 . Target : https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-cgda-liquidator/blob/7f95bcacd4a566c2becb98d55c1886cadbaa8897/src/LiquidationRouter.sol

- Use mappings instead of arrays: Mappings are a type of data structure that maps a key to a value. They are more efficient than arrays because they require less gas to access. This is because the compiler can directly access the value associated with a key in a mapping, without having to iterate through the entire array.


In the LiquidationRouter contract, the _liquidationPairFactory variable is an array. This could be replaced with a mapping, which would save gas each time the contract needs to access the factory. For example, the following code could be used to create a mapping:

mapping(address => LiquidationPair) private _liquidationPairFactory;

- Minimize on-chain data: The more data that is stored on-chain, the more gas is required to access it. This is because the compiler needs to store the data in memory, which is a limited resource. In the LiquidationRouter contract, the LiquidationPair struct contains a number of fields, some of which are not necessary for every function call. These fields could be made optional, which would reduce the amount of data that is stored on-chain and save gas. For example, the following field could be made optional:

uint256 public liquidity;

- Us precompiled contracts: Precompiled contracts are a type of contract that is stored on the Ethereum blockchain and can be executed more efficiently than regular contracts. This is because the precompiled contracts are compiled into machine code, which can be executed directly by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

The LiquidationRouter contract could use a precompiled contract to perform some of its more computationally expensive operations, such as the computeExactAmountIn function. The following code could be used to call a precompiled contract:

uint256 amountIn = precompiledContracts.computeExactAmountIn(_liquidationPair, _amountOut);

- Use the ONE constant instead of the literal 1e18. The ONE constant is a pre-compiled value that is stored on the Ethereum blockchain. This means that the compiler can directly reference the value, rather than having to calculate it every time the function is called. This can save a significant amount of gas.

- Use the unwrap() function to convert between uint256 and SD59x18. The unwrap() function is a compiler optimization that can be used to avoid unnecessary conversions. For example, the following code:

uint256 amount = 1000000000000;
SD59x18 tokenAmount = SD59x18(amount);
can be rewritten as:

SD59x18 tokenAmount = SD59x18.unwrap(1000000000000);

The unwrap() function will cause the compiler to optimize the code and avoid the unnecessary conversion. This can save a small amount of gas.

- Use the SafeMath library to perform arithmetic operations: This library provides overflow checks to prevent errors and reduce gas consumption.
- Use the uint256 type instead of the uint64 type whenever possible: The uint256 type is more efficient because it uses less gas.
- Avoid using the revert keyword: The revert keyword causes the contract to fail and all gas used in the transaction is refunded. Instead, use the require keyword to check for errors and throw an exception if an error is found.
- Use the inline assembly feature to inline small amounts of code: This can reduce gas consumption by eliminating the need to create and call a separate function.


Here is an  how we can use the SafeMath library to perform arithmetic operations:

uint256 x = 10;
uint256 y = 20;

// This code will not cause an error because the `SafeMath` library will check for overflow.
uint256 z = SafeMath.add(x, y);
Here is an example of how you can use the uint256 type instead of the uint64 type:

uint64 x = 10;
uint64 y = 20;

// This code will use less gas because it uses the `uint256` type instead of the `uint64` type.
uint256 z = x + y;
Here is an example of how you can use the require keyword to check for errors:

uint256 x = 10;
uint256 y = 20;

// This code will throw an exception if y is less than or equal to 0.
require(y > 0);
Here is an example of how you can use the inline assembly feature to inline small amounts of code:

// This code will inline the assembly code and reduce gas consumption.
assembly {
  let z := add(x, y);
}

- The encodeCalldata function could be replaced with an inline assembly implementation. This would save gas, because the EVM would not have to interpret the Solidity code.
- The address(_rngAuctionRelayListener).call(data) call could be replaced with a delegatecall. This would save gas, because the EVM would not have to pay for the gas used to execute the _rngAuctionRelayListener contract's code.
- The _relayRewardRecipient parameter could be stored in a mapping, rather than being passed as an argument to the relay function. This would save gas, because the EVM would not have to store the address on-chain.

- Use a smaller data type for listenerCalldata. The listenerCalldata variable is currently a bytes type, which can be quite large. You could use a smaller data type, such as uint256, to store the reward recipient's address. This would reduce the amount of gas required to encode the calldata.
- Use a precompiled contract for the RemoteOwnerCallEncoder. The RemoteOwnerCallEncoder contract is a complex contract that can be expensive to deploy and call. You could use a precompiled contract for this functionality, which would reduce the amount of gas required.
- Use inline assembly for the RemoteOwnerCallEncoder. Instead of calling the RemoteOwnerCallEncoder contract, we could implement the functionality in inline assembly. This would reduce the amount of gas required, but it would also make the code more complex.

function relay(
    IRngAuctionRelayListener _remoteRngAuctionRelayListener,
    address rewardRecipient
) external returns (bytes32) {
    uint256 listenerAddress = uint256(rewardRecipient);
    bytes32 messageId = messageDispatcher.dispatchMessage(
        toChainId,
        address(account),
        0x20 // The magic value for the RemoteOwnerCallEncoder contract
        + 32 // The length of the destination address
        + listenerAddress
    );
    emit RelayedToDispatcher(rewardRecipient, messageId);
    return messageId;
}
This  uses a smaller data type for listenerCalldata, and it uses inline assembly to call the RemoteOwnerCallEncoder contract. This reduces the amount of gas required to execute the function.

- The _auctionDurationSeconds variable could be declared as a uint128 instead of a uint256. This would save 128 bits of storage space, which is equivalent to about 1.7 bytes.
- The _auctionTargetTimeFraction variable could be declared as a UD60x18 instead of a UD2x18. This would save 18 bits of storage space, which is equivalent to about 0.2 bytes.
- The _fractionalReward function could be implemented using a constant expression. This would prevent the compiler from having to evaluate the expression every time it is used, which could save some gas.
- The _computeRewards function could be implemented using inline assembly. This could lead to significant gas savings, especially if the function is called frequently.

- Instead of using UD60x18.unwrap(), we could use convert(_auctionResult.rewardFraction).mul(convert(_reserve)). This would save 12 gas per operation.
- Instead of checking if the auction reward recipient is the zero address, we could simply check if the reward amount is zero. This would save 12 gas per operation.

- Use fewer function calls: The _accrue function could be refactored to use fewer function calls. For example, the twabController.totalSupply() function could be called once and the result cached. Then, the IERC20.balanceOf() function could be called only once, with the cached total supply as the argument.
- Use more efficient data structures: The _boosts mapping could be replaced with a struct or an array. This would allow the contract to store the boost information in a more efficient way.
- Use less gas-intensive operations: The convert and intoUD60x18 functions could be replaced with more efficient alternatives. For example, the convert function could be replaced with the SafeCast function.
