Any comments for the judge to contextualize your findings
My findings were web3 DOS.

Approach taken in evaluating the codebase
I Cloned the code in visual studio.  Then I read the code and looked for bugs.

Architecture recommendations
Use more AI.

Codebase quality analysis
Little use of floating pragma which is good.
Some requirement violations.

Centralization risks
None found.

Mechanism review
Works well as a whole.  
The DOS vulnerabilities may cause some down time.

Systemic risks
None found.  But web3 DOS needs to be patched.
