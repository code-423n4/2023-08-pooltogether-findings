Although I didn't find many vulnerabilities, I found that the way one random number is transmitted to other chains is a great concept, I didn't know it was possible, and I guess more and more defi multichain protocols that are relying on the vrf are going to use similar implementations in order to make requests cheaper. It was a great opportunity, thank you code arena and PoolTogether !
